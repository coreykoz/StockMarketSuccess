# StockMarketSuccess
Our project will delve into the task of using predictive modeling on the stock market using the quantmod library in r. Specifically, we will look at the stock of “Disney”, “Tesla”, “Coca Cola” and based on our analysis, we will determine whether it is worth to buy, sell, or simply hold on to the stocks for the future. We think that it will be interesting to analyze the stocks from these three data sources because each of these companies are in vastly different industries and it will be a fun task to build a model that is able to work for these three companies, and maybe even for the whole stock market. For retrieving data sources, one web api we found was alphavantage.co, a website that provides free, real time or historical data on a variety of stocks. We believe that this may work in addition to quantmod because Alpha Vantage can have us download data into csv files, which are the types of files that we are most comfortable using. Using Alpha Vantage may also be advantageous because we do not think that it is entirely necessary to stream all of the old data; it may be better to just batch-upload the data.
